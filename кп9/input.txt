aaaa	1	Tyger Tyger, burning bright,
aaaa    2   In the forests of the night;
aaac    3   What immortal hand or eye,
aaac    4   Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
aaae    5   In what distant deeps or skies.
aaaf    6   Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
aaag    7   On what wings dare he aspire?
aaah    8   What the hand, dare seize the fire?
aaaj    9   And what shoulder, & what art,
aaax    10  Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
aaay    11  And when thy heart began to beat,
aaaz    12  What dread hand? & what dread feet?
